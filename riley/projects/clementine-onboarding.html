				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>The main goal was to craft the story of the Clementine experience, while introducing new customers to four main features:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>A private Clementine number for business</li>
					<li>Effortless conference calls</li>
					<li>Secure voice and text communication</li>
					<li>Call recording and message archiving</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
				<p>I pinpointed a few apps with onboarding flows that were great examples of the same high-level goals I wanted to achieve: complex interactions or ideas explained in a personable, interactive way. Reading through all of <a href="http://www.useronboard.com/onboarding-teardowns/">Sam Hulick's Onboarding Teardowns</a> also helped <em>a lot</em>.</p>

				<h2>Sketching</h2>
				<p>I start every project with some quick sketches to get feedback from the team about the direction I&rsquo;m taking without letting visuals interfere with critique. However, sketches for this project progressed to a more detailed state than usual since our onboarding is heavily visual. I wanted to outline illustrations/interactions before I moved to Sketch and Framer since redoing them would be incredibly time-consuming.</p>

				<h2>Mockups</h2>
				<p>Storyboarding in Sketch quickly made it clear that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>My idea to convey how Clementine separates your work and personal life was too subtle. My illustrations for work life and home life didn't provide enough contrast to emphasize this feature.</li>
					<li>My idea to feature secure messaging, however, was too over-the-top. The animations and illustrations I had planned would either obscure text or too strictly control pacing for users through the onboarding flow.
				</ul>

				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<p>After tweaking my designs in Sketch, I hopped into Framer for the first time to <em>seriously</em> work on a project. The design team at Clementine had previously used only Pixate and Flinto for interaction prototyping, but I felt the animations for onboarding were complex enough to warrant finally getting my hands dirty with Framer.</p>
