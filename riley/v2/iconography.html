							<h1>Taking Stock</h1>
							<div class="left">
								<p>Several feature sprints at Clementine had resulted in icon bloat, with different icon styles cobbled together each time a new feature required them.</p>
								<p>We needed a complete overhaul of our iconography to reflect the Clementine brand. I chose three words that reflected our product values and aimed for a personable style to align with them.</p>

								<h1>Inspiration</h1>
								<p>For inspiration, I looked mainly to enterprise/B2B products that focused on communication and productivity, as well as products that relied heavily on icons to represent a wide range of concepts and actions.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

								<h1>Sketching</h1>
								<p>Sketching icons with pen and paper allowed me to quickly explore ideas and run them by the team.</p>
								<p>A few icons that warranted more time and discussion:</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Copy contact info to clipboard&mdash;how would I distinguish this from the share icon?</li>
								<li>Conferences&mdash;as a team, we were still deciding on what constituted a conference (Is it scheduled? Is it a multi-person call?) and how it differed from a normal call.</li>
								<li>Directory &amp; Groups&mdash;how can I make these as gender-neutral or as representative of all genders as possible?</li>
								<li>Invite via email/contacts/text&mdash;how can I distinguish this from our normal email, contacts, and text message icons?</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="section">

								<h1>Testing</h1>
								<p>I assembled the first pass at the redesigned icons into their appropriate screens by overlaying them on app screenshots. This made it easy to get feedback since everything was contextualized with real content. The mockups made it clear exactly where the icons and app needed visual and functional improvement.</p>

								<p>I spent more time iterating on icons for groups, empty states, and invite icons since they were challenging in terms of inclusion, tone, and increasing motivation toward an action. I focused on using the right visual tone, while keeping icons as simple, consistent, and meaningful as possible.</p>

								<p>I also took the time to decrease our icon bloat. The conference scheduling screen had icons in almost every entry field. This cluttered a screen that already forced a large amount of cognitive load on the user because of the multiple form actions required. Moreover, the icons didn’t add much utility that the text labels couldn&rsquo;t already provide.</p>

								<h1>Prototyping &amp; Handoff</h1>
								<p>Some of the icons would be used in animated interactions, and I wanted to make sure they&rsquo;d work fully before finishing up the icon set. I built out a few animations to pass to our engineers.</p>
								<p>An important part of the icon redesign process was ensuring assets would be easy to find and replace if any further iterations were done. It was also important for our engineers to be able to quickly and easily find the assets they were looking for since there were a large number we needed to replace.</p>

								<p>I reorganized our asset library by</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Prefixing asset names in the same tab group. For example, the names of all assets that were unique to the Messages tab began with “message-”.</li>
								<li>Making sure icons that shared similar forms had the same subname. For example, all icons with a speech bubble had the word “message” in their file names.</li>
								<li>Creating a reference sheet (below) with asset names and organized by file structure in the library for easy reference. This also made it easy to quickly edit and export assets whenever needed.</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>The New Icons</h1>
								<p>The final set I created came out to over 100 icons (with even more for the desktop app). It primarily used Clementine&rsquo;s orange and grays. The app&rsquo;s previous icons often relied too much on our secondary colors alone to provide visual contrast.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

							<div class="full">
							<h1>Results</h1>
								<p>We heard back from our customers, who were overwhelmingly positive in their feedback. They said that the latest Clementine release with the new icons completely changed the look of the app (for good), which was exactly what we were going for.</p>
								<p>Along the way, I</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Reorganized our asset library to help our engineers build faster and better. It also made it faster for the design team to find and share assets.</li>
								<li>Made the three brand words I relied on at the start of the project (trustworthy, friendly, secure) a key part of our product. These words were the way we began presenting our product to Clementine&rsquo;s different audiences.</li>
								</ul>
