							<h2>Company</h2>
							<p><a href="https://angel.co/clementine-labs">Clementine</a>, a conference call and messaging app for enterprise. Acquired by Dropbox in 2015.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="right">
							<h2>Role &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
							<p>As one of two UI/UX designers, I designed the mobile conference call experience with the main goal of reassuring customers that their calls were being made with their Clementine number and not their personal number.</p>

							<p>An additional requirement for the project was to make the UI scalable with additional call features we had on the product roadmap, including call transferring and conference rescheduling.</p>

								<h1>The Problem</h1>

								<p>Many customers who had experimented with other conference call apps before were used to apps that dial a conference line using the customer&rsquo;s personal phone number. However, one of our core features was that we gave customers their own business line through the app to keep their work and personal lives separate.</p>

								<p>Prior to the redesign, Clementine&rsquo;s conference call screen looked too similar to the iOS phone UI. Through customer feedback and testing, we found that they weren&rsquo;t always sure if calls were being made through the app or through their own phone number.</p>

								<h1>Customer Personas</h1>
								<p>Through interviews with current and potential customers, we developed three personas based on user roles and motivations in Clementine. These were the Employee, the CIO/COO, and the IT Admin. While it was valuable to design to meet the needs of the CIO/COO and IT Admin personas in other areas of the app, the Employee would be the one spending the greatest amount of time making conference calls.</p>
								<p>WTF is the employee persona</p>

							<h1>Competitive Research</h1>
							<div class="left">
								<p>The landscape of enterprise communication is far-reaching. There are apps that only do text-based communication (e.g., Slack, Pie), those that do text and voice (e.g., Convoi), and those that do voice through another product (e.g., UberConference, Hall).</p>

								<p>I looked mainly at telephony apps to get a sense how other products are handling phone calls, especially with multiple people on the line. I also took a look at more consumer-focused communication products that receive a larger scale of customers.</p>

								<p>General trends I found were that</p>

								<ul>
								<li>There&rsquo;s a limited number of tasks you can perform when you&rsquo;re in a call. Many apps don&rsquo;t let you return to the normal app UI.</li>
								<li>Not many apps showed who was in the call and who wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
								<li>The ways in which you could start a conference call varied, but the majority of apps required you to start from a preexisting group, not with an ad hoc group.</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>Sketching</h1>
								<p>I sketched out a few ideas to get high-level feedback from the team. Questions I mulled over during sketching were:</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Which call functionalities should be top-level during a call, and which can be hidden?</li>
								<li>Do customers need to be able to always see who&rsquo;s on a call, or is communicating through voice sufficient?</li>
								<li>How do we strike a balance between making the call experience a cohesive part of the whole product and making it different enough from the rest of the app so customers know for sure whenever they&rsquo;re in a call?</li>
								</ul>
