							<p>I redesigned the mobile conference call flow to reassure customers that their calls were being made through Clementine and not their personal number.</p>

							<p>Create a seamless Clementine-branded conference call experience that would be flexible when incorporating additional call features we had on the development roadmap, such as call transferring, a dial pad, and conference rescheduling.</p>

								<h1>The Problem</h1>
								<p>The goal of redesigning the conference call flow was to build and sustain trust with customers throughout the entire call experience.</p>

								<p>Customers who had tried different conference call apps were used to apps that dial a conference line using the customer&rsquo;s personal phone number. However, one of Clementine&rsquo;s core features is that customers receive their own business line through the app to keep their work and personal lives separate.</p>

								<p>Prior to the redesign, Clementine&rsquo;s conference call screen looked too similar to the iOS phone UI. Customers remarked that they weren&rsquo;t always sure if calls were being made through the app or through their own phone number.</p>

							<h1>Competitive Research</h1>
							<div class="left">
								<p>The landscape of enterprise communication is far-reaching. There are apps that only do text-based communication (e.g., Slack, Pie), those that do text and voice (e.g., Convoi), and those that do voice through another product (e.g., UberConference, Hall).</p>

								<p>I looked mainly at telephony apps to get a sense how other products are handling phone calls, especially with multiple people on the line. I also took a look at more consumer-focused communication products that receive a larger scale of customers.</p>

								<p>General trends I found were that</p>

								<ul>
								<li>There&rsquo;s a limited number of tasks you can perform when you&rsquo;re in a call. Many apps don&rsquo;t let you return to the normal app UI.</li>
								<li>Not many apps showed who was in the call and who wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
								<li>The ways in which you could start a conference call varied, but the majority of apps required you to start from a preexisting group, not with an ad hoc group.</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>Sketching</h1>
								<p>I sketched out a few ideas to get high-level feedback from the team. Questions I mulled over during sketching were:</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Which call functionalities should be top-level during a call, and which can be hidden?</li>
								<li>Do customers need to be able to always see who&rsquo;s on a call, or is communicating through voice sufficient?</li>
								<li>How do we strike a balance between making the call experience a cohesive part of the whole product and making it different enough from the rest of the app so customers know for sure whenever they&rsquo;re in a call?</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>User Testing</h1>
								<p>I assembled the first pass at the redesigned icons into their appropriate screens by overlaying them on app screenshots. This made it easy to get feedback since everything was contextualized with real content. The mockups made it clear exactly where the icons and app needed visual and functional improvement.</p>

								<p>I spent more time iterating on icons for groups, empty states, and invite icons since they were challenging in terms of inclusion, tone, and increasing motivation toward an action. I focused on using the right visual tone, while keeping icons as simple, consistent, and meaningful as possible.</p>

								<p>I also took the time to decrease our icon bloat. The conference scheduling screen had icons in almost every entry field. This cluttered a screen that already forced a large amount of cognitive load on the user because of the multiple form actions required. Moreover, the icons didn’t add much utility that the text labels couldn&rsquo;t already provide.</p>

								<h1>The Redesigned Conference Call</h1>
								<p>Some of the icons would be used in animated interactions, and I wanted to make sure they&rsquo;d work fully before finishing up the icon set. I built out a few animations to pass to our engineers.</p>
								<p>An important part of the icon redesign process was ensuring assets would be easy to find and replace if any further iterations were done. It was also important for our engineers to be able to quickly and easily find the assets they were looking for since there were a large number we needed to replace.</p>

								<p>I reorganized our asset library by</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Prefixing asset names in the same tab group. For example, the names of all assets that were unique to the Messages tab began with “message-”.</li>
								<li>Making sure icons that shared similar forms had the same subname. For example, all icons with a speech bubble had the word “message” in their file names.</li>
								<li>Creating a reference sheet (below) with asset names and organized by file structure in the library for easy reference. This also made it easy to quickly edit and export assets whenever needed.</li>
								</ul>
