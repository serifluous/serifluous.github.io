							<h2>Role &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
							<p>As one of two UI/UX designers, I redesigned the mobile conference call flow to reassure customers that their calls were being made through Clementine and not their personal number.</p>

							<p>Create a seamless Clementine-branded conference call experience that would be flexible when incorporating additional call features we had on the development roadmap, such as call transferring, a dial pad, and conference rescheduling.</p>

								<h1>The Problem</h1>
								<p>The goal of redesigning the conference call flow was to build and sustain trust with customers throughout the entire call experience.</p>

								<p>Customers who had tried different conference call apps were used to apps that dial a conference line using the customer&rsquo;s personal phone number. However, one of Clementine&rsquo;s core features is that customers receive their own business line through the app to keep their work and personal lives separate.</p>

								<p>Prior to the redesign, Clementine&rsquo;s conference call screen looked too similar to the iOS phone UI. Customers remarked that they weren&rsquo;t always sure if calls were being made through the app or through their own phone number.</p>

							<h1>Competitive Research</h1>
							<div class="left">
								<p>The landscape of enterprise communication is far-reaching. There are apps that only do text-based communication (e.g., Slack, Pie), those that do text and voice (e.g., Convoi), and those that do voice through another product (e.g., UberConference, Hall).</p>

								<p>I looked mainly at telephony apps to get a sense how other products are handling phone calls, especially with multiple people on the line. I also took a look at more consumer-focused communication products that receive a larger scale of customers.</p>

								<p>General trends I found were that</p>

								<ul>
								<li>There&rsquo;s a limited number of tasks you can perform when you&rsquo;re in a call. Many apps don&rsquo;t let you return to the normal app UI.</li>
								<li>Not many apps showed who was in the call and who wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
								<li>The ways in which you could start a conference call varied, but the majority of apps required you to start from a preexisting group, not with an ad hoc group.</li>

								<h1>Sketching</h1>
								<p>I sketched out a few ideas to get high-level feedback from the team. Questions I mulled over during sketching were:</p>

								<ul>
								<li>Which call functionalities should be top-level during a call, and which can be hidden?</li>
								<li>Do customers need to be able to always see who&rsquo;s on a call, or is communicating through voice sufficient?</li>
								<li>How do we strike a balance between making the call experience a cohesive part of the whole product and making it different enough from the rest of the app so customers know for sure whenever they&rsquo;re in a call?</li>
								</ul>
