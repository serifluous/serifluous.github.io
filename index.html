<!-- 		<h2 class="f4">Getting to know our customers</h2>
			<p class="f5">There were plenty of popular misconceptions we knew were untrue about our customers when we looked at the data. Our customers skewed older, most were homeowners, and they often knew their finances down to the cent but didn&rsquo;t have the liquidity to help keep them permanently afloat.</p>
			<p class="f5">But&mdash;just by virtue of being employees at a Bay Area tech company&mdash;we knew we weren&rsquo;t our customers. We were always conscious of striking the right tone in our product features and copy. There was a fine line between being patronizing and being helpful.</p>
			<p class="f5">We used a variety of research methods to avoid designing in a silo and make sure we knew who our customers were. This included <em>ethnographic research, design sprints, usability testing, shadowing customer support calls, outbound customer feedback calls, a dedicated social impact team, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">industry</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank">reading</a></em>.</p> -->

			<p class="tc">
				<img class="measure-narrow-ns" src="images/dashboard-hero.png" alt="Screenshot of finished Arrow Card mobile app" />
			</p>

			<p class="f5">LendUp provides loans and credit cards to customers who are often denied access to credit by traditional banks. Driven by a social mission to improve people&rsquo;s financial health, LendUp builds products with financial education, transparency, and dignity in mind.</p>
				<!-- <p class="f5">The experience of the mobile app also mirrored the direction that LendUp wanted to move in as a full financial partner to our customers. Traditionally, LendUp provided loans, which are low-touch experiences (customers logged in to take out loan, then logged in just once more to pay it off), but credit cards could drive far more engagement.</p> -->
				<!-- Graph of loans vs. cards engagement, checking balances, multiple payments, checking transactions -->
			<p class="f5">I led the redesign of LendUp&rsquo;s Arrow credit card mobile app account dashboard. I worked alongside a product manager, copywriter, and front-end engineer, and regularly checked in with the design team.</p>

<!-- 			<h3 class="f5">Why the mobile app matters</h3>
				<p class="f5">At the time, the mobile app was our only in-house product customers could use to self-service their account information. Our web experience wasn&rsquo;t yet publicly available. Instead, customers who logged onto our website were sent through a third-party payment processor.</p>
				<p class="f5">Our data also showed that the mobile app:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>drove higher daily engagement than web (a <a href="https://cfsinnovation.org/research/eight-ways-to-measure-financial-health/">measure of financial health</a> according to the CFSI)</li>
					<li>on average, monthly payments on the mobile app were 20% higher</li>
				</ul> -->
			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">The problem</h2>
				<p class="f5">Our support team receives calls with basic questions about customers&rsquo; balance, credit, and the payment process. In mid-2017, these calls drove about 30% of total call volume.</p>
				<p class="f5">After digging into these calls, we knew there were improvements we could make in the usability of the account dashboard, where we showed customers that information.</p>

				<p class="tc f5 i caption">The Arrow Card dashboard in 2017</p>
				<p class="tc">
					<img class="measure-narrow-ns ba br3" src="images/dashboard-old_app.png" alt="Screenshot of Arrow Card mobile app in 2017" />
				</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Goals</h2>
				<p class="f5">At a high-level, our goals were to:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Decrease the number of customer calls about known issues, including the lack of clarity around available credit, credit line, and payment information. <!-- This would be <em>quantitative and measurable</em>. --></li>
					<li>Discover and address usability issues given time and resource constraints, which meant we were limited in considering a broader redesign. <!-- This would be <em>qualitative and testable</em>. --></li>
				</ul>
			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Research &amp; testing</h2>
				<p class="f5">From past research, we already knew that our customers needed to know their <strong>available credit</strong> more immediately than their current balance, and also often wanted to know their <strong>credit line</strong>. Since our customers were credit-constrained, the amount of credit they had was always top of mind.</p>
				<p class="f5">To discover any unknown issues, we decided to run usability tests on the dashboard and also found that people</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Didn&rsquo;t want their <strong>credit score</strong> to be prominent for privacy and emotional reasons</li>
					<li>Were intrigued but weren&rsquo;t sure why <strong>credit utilization</strong> was shown</li>
					<li>Couldn&rsquo;t figure out <strong>how to contact support</strong> but would instinctively scroll to find information they couldn&rsquo;t immediately find</li>
					<li>Weren&rsquo;t always sure <strong>if a payment was due</strong></li>
					<li>Often had to squint or bring their phone up close to read text in the app</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="f5">The findings confirmed much of what we knew&mdash;that the dashboard information hierarchy was unclear, that the app needed to suit audiences with different vision abilities&mdash;but also uncovered much we didn&rsquo;t know, especially around the emotional experience of checking your account information.</p>
			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">The framework</h2>
				<p class="f5">For this project, we adopted the framework in Jason Fried&rsquo;s article <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible" target="_blank">the Obvious, the Easy, and the Possible</a> (OEP) for hierarchy discussions with stakeholders. This helped direct conversations that could&rsquo;ve derailed with a comment like, &ldquo;Can you make the font bigger?&rdquo; to more productive discussions around what information to prioritize.</p>
				<p class="f4 ml4">Instead of discussing isolated components, we were now discussing trade-offs.</p>
				<p class="f5">From this framework and our research, I landed on a hierarchy for the dashboard.</p>

				<p class="tc">
					<img class="measure-narrow-ns" src="images/dashboard-OEP.png" alt="Obvious, Easy, Possible chart for the mobile dashboard" />
				</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">The proposal</h2>
			<h3 class="f4">Larger type, more linear information flow</h3>	
				<img class="mw5-ns ml4-ns" src="images/dashboard-proposal1.png" alt="Old vs. new information flow. Animation of account carousel" />
				<p class="f5">The dashboard now prioritizes the information that customers need most immediately: available credit, minimum payment information, and making a payment. We moved information that was less desired upfront into a tabbed carousel.</p>

			<h3 class="f4 mt4">More discoverable contact form and settings</h3>
				<img class="mw5-ns ml4-ns" src="images/dashboard-proposal2.png" alt="Animation of scrolling to footer" />
				<p class="f5">Customers can get to their settings and the contact form right on the dashboard instead of having to guess at whether it might be revealed by a side menu icon.</p>
			<h3 class="f4 mt4">A simplified, more human payments card</h3>
				<img class="mw6-ns" src="images/dashboard-proposal3.png" alt="Moved payment information onto separate payments screen" />
				<p class="f5">We moved unnecessary payment information off the main dashboard and onto a separate payments screen to keep the payments card as obvious as possible. I worked with our copywriter to humanize the language around making payments.</p>
			<h3 class="f4 mt4">Modular card UI system</h3>
				<img class="mw6-ns" src="images/dashboard-proposal4.png" alt="Modular card UI system" />
				<p class="f5">This project was a testing ground for our <a href="#case-system">new design component system</a>. I developed a modular card system that we could use for a variety of flows and information types so we could scale our UI and front-end efficiency with new features on the credit card and loans products.</p>
			<h3 class="f4 mt4">New visual identity</h3>
				<img class="ml4-ns ba br2" src="images/dashboard-final.gif" alt="Full dashboard animation" />
				<p class="f5">During this project, LendUp had adopted a new visual identity, and the mobile app was the first customer servicing touchpoint designed to reflect the new brand.</p>
			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Releasing and iterating on the new dashboard</h2>
				<p class="f5">As much as upfront testing helps, releasing the first version of the new dashboard to the public meant there were still issues to be discovered. Thankfully, we had the opportunity to iterate by:</p>

				<h2 class="f3 tc">1</h2>
				<p class="f5"><strong>Further condensing top-level information.</strong> An earlier version kept credit utilization and the pending transaction amount in the first account summary card where they weren&rsquo;t needed.</p>
				<!-- <img src="" alt="Multiple iterations of the account summary card." /> -->

				<h2 class="f3 tc">2</h2>
				<p class="f5"><strong>Refining the meters in the carousel cards.</strong> We tested iterations where we changed color or did away with the meter altogether, but the meter helped customers anchor their spending.</p>
				<!-- <img src="" alt="Multiple iterations of the carousel meters or the meter style guide" /> -->

				<h2 class="f3 tc">3</h2>
				<p class="f5"><strong>Testing prototypes that demonstrated even broader redesigns of the dashboard</strong>. This helped us further identify what information customers prioritized.</p>
				<!-- <img src="" alt="Multiple animations of broader dashboard redesigns" /> -->

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Results</h2>
				<p class="f5">Since launch:</p>
				<p class="f4">Balance and payment inquiry call volume <em>decreased by ~38%</em>.</p>
				<p class="f4">We ran usability testing again, and participants <em>identified available credit, payment, and contact information faster</em> than in previous tests.</p>
				<p class="f4">Customers now show <em>more focused interaction</em> with the dashboard on the actions we want them to tap on.</p>

		<h1 class="f2" id="case-system">Managing a design system</h1>
			<!-- <img src="" alt="Design system flowchart for engineering, design, and source of truth" /> -->
			<p class="f5">In late 2017, LendUp adopted a new visual identity, Upswing. We had new styles and some basic components but still had a long way to ago before it could scale across all our products and platforms.</p>
			<p class="f5">In other words, we had a few components but <em>no design system and needed a plan to roll out Upswing</em>.</p>

			<p class="f5">The design team knew that to have a functioning design system, we needed to establish processes upfront, not just components. Figuring out how to manage components across design and engineering would be just as important as building them in the first place.</p>

			<p class="tc">
				<img class="mw5-ns" src="images/system-goals.png" alt="Components circle inside design system circle" />
			</p>
			<p class="tc f5 i caption">Components are just one part within a larger design system.</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Goals</h2>

				<p class="f5 mt4">I created goals for managing our design system to make it:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li><strong>Usable for customers</strong> &mdash;It should be easy to design components that are intuitive and accessible to our customers.</li>
					<li><strong>Usable for the design team</strong>&mdash;It should be easy to share components across the design team.</li>
					<li><strong>Scalable</strong>&mdash;It should be trivial for front-end engineers to extend components to new states and use cases.</li>
					<li><strong>Trackable</strong>&mdash;It should be easy for the design and engineering teams to check in on progress.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Proof of concept</h2>
				<p class="f5">Working with a front-end engineer, I used our credit card mobile app as a testing ground for how we might start applying Upswing. Because the app&rsquo;s codebase was fairly isolated, it made it easy to test there first without major ripple effects.</p>

				<p class="f5">After applying Upswing to the app and building out missing components, we validated its usability during the <a href="#case-dashboard">redesign of the app dashboard</a>  to make sure components worked well together and were intuitive for customers.</p>
				<p class="tc">
					<img class="mw6-ns ba br2" src="images/system-cards.png" alt="New components: Card system design guidelines" />
				</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4"><span class="strike">Failing</span> Learning fast</h2>
				<p class="f5">With this momentum, each designer held initial talks with their product managers to discuss how we might start applying Upswing across the board.</p>
				<p class="f5">We realized we could quickly sell product managers on the importance of a cohesive identity. However, it&rsquo;d be hard for <em>them</em> to turn around and sell the idea of committing design and engineering time to a major &ldquo;visual redesign&rdquo; project.</p>
				<p class="f5">What we ended up agreeing on was that any new projects on the product roadmap would be built with our new system. I&rsquo;d already set up components in Sketch so designers could build mockups with them in less time than with our old design language. On the engineering side, there&rsquo;d be a little overhead per project, but the piecemeal effort was an easier sell than a team-wide commitment of work.</p>
				
				<p class="f4 ml4">Any work done now with Upswing would contribute to less design and technical debt down the road.</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">The proposal</h2>
				<p class="f5">With the product team&rsquo;s buy-in, we could start honing the design system and processes.</p>

				<h3 class="f4">Designing components</h3>
					<p class="f5">Despite all this talk of internal processes, customers were still our #1 concern. Since we were creating so many new components, we needed to set usability standards to validate them.</p>
					<p class="f5">We adopted accessibility checklists and Eva Kaniasty&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lendup.com/blog/design-quality.html" target="_blank">CARMEL</a> guidelines to score the quality of our work. We built on top of the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible" target="_blank">Obvious, Easy, Possible</a> framework and started mapping relationships between an element&rsquo;s hierarchy and an appropriate component style.</p>
				<p class="tc">
					<img class="mw5-ns" src="images/system-OEP.png" alt="Mapping button styles to OEP" />
				</p>
				<p class="f5 caption i tc">How OEP mapped to our button components</p>

				<h3 class="f4 mt4">Sharing components</h3>
					<img class="ba br2" src="images/system-abstract.png" alt="Our Sketch libraries in Abstract" />
					<p class="f5">We settled on Sketch libraries and <a href="https://www.goabstract.com/" target="_blank">Abstract</a> as a way of sharing and managing our components. I helped manage a library of shared global components, while each team managed their own library of product- or platform-specific components.</p>
					<p class="f5">Since we were creating components piecemeal, we held frequent design reviews to make sure we were all in sync. Reviews were helpful for identifying components that could be used across teams and were then promoted to the shared library.</p>

				<h3 class="f4 mt4">Scaling components</h3>
					<p class="f5">We approached every new project with the assumption that a component or screen design wouldn&rsquo;t be a one-off solution. Because our CARMEL guidelines emphasized <strong>coherence</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>, the quality of our work was evaluated on whether it reused existing Upswing components.</p>
				
					<img src="images/system-card_examples.png" alt="Card component examples" />
					<p class="f5 caption i tc">The card component could be extended to different use cases across products.</p>

					<p class="f5">This in turn made conversations with engineers easier when we knew upfront what components could be adapted with minimal engineering work.</p>

				<h3 class="f4 mt4">Tracking progress</h3>
					<p class="f5">I landed on a simple shared text table to track touchpoints, ownership, status, and relevant documentation so we knew what we still had left to do. We had too many non-digital touchpoints <!-- (<em>e.g.</em>, credit card plastics, physical mail assets)  -->or ones that couldn&rsquo;t easily link to existing issue tracker tools. Sometimes, a text doc will just end up being the most flexible way to PM.</p>
					<p class="f5">On the engineering side, I collaborated with an engineer to build a developer menu to audit components on the mobile app. On web, engineers leveraged <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank">Storybook</a>.</p>
					
					<p class="tc">
						<img class="mw5-ns" src="images/system-dev_menu.png" alt="Screenshot of developer menu" />
					</p>
					<p class="f5 caption i tc">The in-app developer menu</p>

			<h2 class="f4 bb mt4">Results</h2>

				<p class="f5">The processes that got us to shipping Upswing made us more efficient at producing quality work and communicating with our teams. Bringing product and engineering into the design system process meant we all had a shared language to talk about hierarchy, components, and visual style&mdash;conversations that could otherwise end in cross-functional misunderstandings.</p>

				<p class="f5">Setting usability and quality standards meant that the design team presented cohesive work to our product and engineering teams, but <em>more importantly</em>, to our customers.</p>

				<img class="ba br2" src="images/system-final.png" alt="Final design guidelines" />

				<p class="f5">For our customers, who are already time-, resource-, and money-constrained, it can be hard to tolerate one more frustrating and disappointing experience, especially with their financial institutions.</p>

				<p class="f5">Our new processes meant that we could ship cohesive experiences faster. And a cohesive experience meant that our customers could <em>also</em> be efficient in accomplishing what they needed to in our products and enabled to take care of what actually matters to them outside our products.</p>

<!-- 				<h3 class="f5">What&rsquo;s next</h3>

				<p class="f5">This whole project made it clear how important a <em>source of truth</em> is.</p>

				<p class="f5">Easier for components to be shared across design and engineering. No longer had discrepancies in components, but even if we did, it didn&rsquo;t matter because engineers could rely on components in code to plug in instead of having to create one-off styles</p>

				<p class="f5">What&rsquo;s next: Swingset + in a way, making <em>managing</em> the Sketch library obsolete. Leveraged Storybook. Trivial going from wireframe to code. Engineers never need to inspect/redline again.

				Wireframe symbols to replacing with high-fidelity components (still needed for stakeholder reviews) to Swingset.
