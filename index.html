<!-- 		<h2 class="f4">Getting to know our customers</h2>
			<p class="f5">There were plenty of popular misconceptions we knew were untrue about our customers when we looked at the data. Our customers skewed older, most were homeowners, and they often knew their finances down to the cent but didn&rsquo;t have the liquidity to help keep them permanently afloat.</p>
			<p class="f5">But&mdash;just by virtue of being employees at a Bay Area tech company&mdash;we knew we weren&rsquo;t our customers. We were always conscious of striking the right tone in our product features and copy. There was a fine line between being patronizing and being helpful.</p>
			<p class="f5">We used a variety of research methods to avoid designing in a silo and make sure we knew who our customers were. This included <em>ethnographic research, design sprints, usability testing, shadowing customer support calls, outbound customer feedback calls, a dedicated social impact team, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">industry</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank">reading</a></em>.</p> -->

					<li><strong>Feature validation</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, design sprints, to answer <em>Do customers care about any these features? Will they like the way they&rsquo;re framed?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Usability testing</strong> to answer <em>Did we satisfy the customer goals? Can people do the things we want them to be able to do?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Shadowing inbound customer support calls</strong> to answer <em>Who are our customers? How does our product succeed or fail at providing utility for them?</em></li>

		<h1 class="f3" id="case-dashboard">Redesigning the credit card dashboard</h1>

			<img src="" alt="Screenshot of finished Arrow Card mobile app" />

				<p class="f5">LendUp provides loans and credit cards to customers who are often denied access to credit by traditional banks. Driven by a social mission to improve people&rsquo;s financial health, LendUp builds products with financial education, transparency, and dignity in mind.</p>
				<!--<p class="f5">In mid-2017, I joined the Arrow Card mobile app team, and we were tasked with taking the mobile app from an MVP demo app to a fully fledged customer-facing app and LendUp&rsquo;s only native mobile product.</p> -->
				<!-- <p class="f5">The experience of the mobile app also mirrored the direction that LendUp wanted to move in as a full financial partner to our customers. Traditionally, LendUp provided loans, which are low-touch experiences (customers logged in to take out loan, then logged in just once more to pay it off), but credit cards could drive far more engagement.</p> -->
				<!-- Graph of loans vs. cards engagement, checking balances, multiple payments, checking transactions -->
				<p class="f5">I led the redesign of LendUp&rsquo;s Arrow Card mobile app account dashboard. I worked alongside a product manager, copywriter, and front-end engineer, and regularly checked in with the design team.</p>

<!-- 			<h3 class="f5">Why the mobile app matters</h3>
				<p class="f5">At the time, the mobile app was our only in-house product customers could use to self-service their account information. Our web experience wasn&rsquo;t yet publicly available. Instead, customers who logged onto our website were sent through a third-party payment processor.</p>
				<p class="f5">Our data also showed that the mobile app:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>drove higher daily engagement than web (a <a href="https://cfsinnovation.org/research/eight-ways-to-measure-financial-health/">measure of financial health</a> according to the CFSI)</li>
					<li>on average, monthly payments on the mobile app were 20% higher</li>
				</ul> -->

			<img src="" alt="Screenshot of Arrow Card mobile app in 2017" />
			<h2 class="f4">The problem</h2>
				<p class="f5">Our support team receives calls with basic questions about customers&rsquo; balance, credit, and the payment process. In mid-2017, these calls drove about 30% of the total call volume.</p>
				<p class="f5">After digging into these calls, we knew there were improvements we could make in the usability of the account dashboard, the first screen customers land on in the app.</p>
			<h2 class="f4">Goals</h2>
				<p class="f5">At a high-level, our goals were to</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Decrease the number of customer calls about known issues, including the lack of clarity around available credit, credit line, and payment information. <!-- This would be <em>quantitative and measurable</em>. --></li>
					<li>Discover and address usability issues given time and resource constraints, which meant we were limited in considering a broader redesign. <!-- This would be <em>qualitative and testable</em>. --></li>
				</ul>
			<h2 class="f4">Research &amp; testing</h2>
				<p class="f5">From past research, we already knew that our customers needed to know their <strong>available credit</strong> more immediately than their current balance<!--  (which is the inverse of account dashboards aimed at consumers with prime credit) -->, and also often wanted to know their <strong>credit line</strong>. Since our customers were credit-constrained, the amount of credit they had was always top of mind.</p>
				<p class="f5">To discover any unknown issues, we decided to run usability tests on the dashboard and also found that people</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Didn&rsquo;t want their <strong>credit score</strong> to be prominent for privacy and emotional reasons</li>
					<li>Were intrigued but weren&rsquo;t sure why <strong>credit utilization</strong> was shown</li>
					<li>Couldn&rsquo;t figure out <strong>how to contact support</strong> but would instinctively scroll to find information they couldn&rsquo;t immediately find</li>
					<li>Weren&rsquo;t always sure <strong>if a payment was due</strong></li>
					<li>Often had to squint or bring their phone up close to read text in the app</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="f5">The findings confirmed much of what we knew&mdash;that the dashboard information hierarchy was unclear, that the app needed to suit audiences with different vision abilities&mdash;but also uncovered much we didn&rsquo;t know, especially around the emotional experience of checking your account information. <!-- For someone who&rsquo;s already time-, resource-, and money-constrained, there&rsquo;s much less emotional tolerance for one more frustrating experience. --></p>
			<h2 class="f4">The framework</h2>
				<p class="f5">For this project, we adopted the framework in Jason Fried&rsquo;s article <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible" target="_blank">the Obvious, the Easy, and the Possible</a> (OEP) for hierarchy discussions with stakeholders. This helped direct conversations that could&rsquo;ve derailed with a comment like, &ldquo;Can you make the font bigger?&rdquo; to more productive discussions around what information to prioritize.</p>
				<p class="f5"><em>Instead of discussing isolated components, we were now discussing trade-offs</em>.</p>
				<p class="f5">From this framework and our research, I landed on a hierarchy for the dashboard.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Obvious, Easy, Possible chart for the mobile dashboard" />

			<h2 class="f4">The proposal</h4>
			<h3 class="f5">Larger type, more linear information flow</h4>
				<img src="" alt="Old vs. new information flow. Animation of account carousel" />
				<p class="f5">The dashboard now prioritizes the information that customers need most immediately: available credit, minimum payment information, and making a payment. Information that was less desired upfront was moved into a tabbed carousel.</p>
			<h3 class="f5">Making the contact form and settings more discoverable</h4>
				<img src="" alt="Animation of scrolling to footer" />
				<p class="f5">Customers can get to their settings and the contact form right on the dashboard instead of having to guess at whether it might be revealed by a side menu icon.</p>
			<h3 class="f5">A simplified, more human payments card</h4>
				<img src="" alt="Moved payment information onto separate payments screen" />
				<p class="f5">We moved unnecessary payment information off the main dashboard and onto a separate payments screen to keep the payments card as obvious as possible. I worked with our copywriter to humanize the language around making payments.</p>
			<h3 class="f5">Modular card UI system</h4>
				<img src="" alt="Modular card UI system" />
				<p class="f5">This project was a testing ground for our <a href="#case-system">new design component system</a>. I developed a modular card system that we could use for a variety of flows and information types so we could scale our UI and front-end efficiency with new features on the credit card and loans products.</p>
			<h3 class="f5">New visual identity and style guides</h4>
				<img src="" alt="Upswing style guide snippet" />
				<p class="f5">During this project, LendUp had adopted a new visual identity, and the mobile app was the first customer servicing touchpoint designed to reflect the new brand.</p>
<!-- 			<h2 class="f4">How we got there</h2>
			<p class="f5"></p> -->
			<h2 class="f4">Releasing and iterating on the new dashboard</h2>
				<p class="f5">As much as upfront testing helps, releasing the first version of the new dashboard to the public meant there were still issues to be discovered. Thankfully, we had the opportunity to iterate by:</p>

				<img src="" alt="Multiple iterations of the account summary card." />
				<p class="f5">Further condensing the top-level information, making the information we wanted to be obvious even more obvious. An earlier version kept credit utilization and pending transactions details in the top-level account summary card.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Multiple iterations of the carousel meters or the meter style guide" />
				<p class="f5">Refining the meters in the carousel cards. We went through multiple iterations where we changed color or did away with the meter altogether.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Multiple animations of broader dashboard redesigns" />
				<p class="f5">Testing prototypes that demonstrated even broader redesigns of the dashboard to further identify what customers found useful and inform the future shape of the app.</p>

			<h2 class="f4">Results</h2>
				<p class="f5">Since launch:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Balance and payment inquiry call volume <em>decreased by about 38%</em>.</li>
						<li>We ran usability testing again, and participants <em>identified available credit, payment, and contact information faster</em> than in previous tests.</li>
						<li>Customers have shown <em>more focused interaction</em> with the dashboard on the actions we want them to tap on.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="" alt="Evolution of touch hot spots on the dashboard" />
				<p class="f5">The Arrow Card app is available now on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arrow-card/id1228440036?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lcard_app" target="_blank">Play Store</a>.</p>
<!-- 				<p class="f5">We&rsuo;ve also gotten great feedback from customers on the app.</p> -->


		<h1 class="f3" id="case-system">Managing the design system process</h1>
			<img src="" alt="Design system flowchart for engineering, design, and source of truth" />
			<p class="f5">In late 2017, LendUp adopted a new visual identity, Upswing.<!--  However, when applying Upswing across all our products, we had basic components (<em>e.g.</em>., links, buttons), but they weren&rsquo;t defined enough for all touchpoints within our products. We couldn&rsquo;t do a simple find-and-replace to update type, colors, and spacing.</p>
			<p class="f5"> --> We had new styles and some basic components but still had a long way to ago before they could scale across all our products and platforms.<!-- and in our CSS, and weren&rsquo;t yet extended to React components to use in our web and mobile apps. --></p>

			<p class="f5">In other words, we had some components but <em>no system and needed a plan to roll out Upswing</em>.</p>
			<!-- <p class="f5">Starting in 2018, I managed the process of applying our design system across products and platforms, and led the design of our card components. This project also certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without both the design and engineering teams&rsquo; flexibility and openness to experiment.</p> -->
				<p class="f5"></p>
			<h2 class="f4">Goals</h2>
				<p class="f5">The design team knew that to have a functioning design system, we needed to establish processes upfront, not just components. Figuring out how to manage components across design and engineering would be just as important as building them in the first place.</p>
				<p class="f5">I created goals for managing our design system to make it:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<!-- <li><strong>Trackable</strong>&mdash;It should be easy to sync on what work still needed to be done</li> -->
					<li><strong>Usable for the design team</strong>&mdash;It should be easy to share components across the design team.</li>
					<li><strong>Usable for customers</strong> &mdash;It should be easy to design components that are obvious and accessible to our customers.
					<li><strong>Scalable</strong>&mdash;It should be trivial for front-end engineers to extend components for new states and use cases.</li>
					<li><strong>Trackable</strong>&mdash;It should be easy for the design and engineering teams to check on progress.
				</ul>
			<h2 class="f4">Proof of concept</h2>
				<p class="f5">Working with a front-end engineer, I used the mobile app as a proof of concept for how we might start applying Upswing.</p>

				<p class="f5">Mobile app was good bc codebase was isolated. We could test processes first w/o changes to other products.</p>

				<p class="f5">Tested usability. Modular card components. Developer menu for auditing and tracking.</p>

<!-- 				<p class="f5">As we worked, we began to see where things might go wrong. Some components could be easily adapted from old ones but others needed to be rebuilt entirely.</p>
				<p class="f5">Going through all the components in the codebase together would be extremely inefficient since it wasn&rsquo;t straightforward to tell if the final visual implementation were correct.</p>
				<p class="f5">To help with this, we created a developer menu within the app for our primary components. It made it quicker for me to visually audit components and for both of us to know whether we needed to update or create a new component.</p>
				<img src="" alt="Screenshot of the developer menu" />

				<p class="f5">I kept the goals of our design system in mind as I:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Built new components using Sketch symbols to make them easily <strong>reusable</strong> for myself and eventually modular and <strong>scalable</strong> when coded.</li>
					<li>Validated information hierarchy through testing and used <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">accessibility</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.auditor&hl=en_US" target="_blank">checkers</a> to make sure components worked well together and were <strong>usable</strong> for customers</li>
					<li>Created a list of screens to <strong>track</strong> what needed to be updated and the status of each.</li>
				</ul> -->

			<h2 class="f4"><span class="strike">Failing</span> Learning fast</h2>
				<p class="f5">Based on learnings from the mobile app, other teams gradually began applying Upswing across different products. But if we wanted to make sure components were usable and consistent for designers, engineers, and customers across the entire organization, there was more we needed to do.</p>
				<p class="f5">We were already seeing slight variations of components show up across different designers&rsquo; mockups.</p>
				<img src="" alt="Discrepancies in borders between a button component in Sketch" />
				<p class="f5">We started leveraging new design tools (like <a href="https://www.goabstract.com/" target="_blank">Abstract</a> and Sketch libraries) and borrow processes from engineering workflows to stage and review components.</p>

			<h2 class="f4">The proposal</h2>

				<h3 class="f5">Sharing components</h3>
				<img src="" alt="Sketch library" />
					<p class="f5">We settled on Sketch libraries and Abstract as a way of sharing and managing our components. In Abstract, we created one main Upswing project with Sketch libraries of our shared components. In separate touchpoint-specific projects, we created Sketch libraries with product- or platform-specific components (<em>e.g.</em>, mobile app navigation headers).</p>

				<h3 class="f5">Designing components</h3>
				<img src="" alt="Accessibility checklist" />
					<p class="f5">Usability checklists: Eva Kaniasty&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.slipperstudios.com/services/carmel-ux/">CARMEL</a> + accessibility checklist. Mapping hierarchy (OEP) to components and styles.</p>

				<h3 class="f5">Scaling components</h3>
				<img src="" alt="Screenshot of tables" />
					<p class="f5">Never assuming a component or screen design is a one-off design. Weekly design reviews helped to keep us in sync. Design components with modularity in mind. Nested Sketch symbols.</p>
					<p class="f5">Table component example: used for payments, transactions, and links</p>

				<h3 class="f5">Tracking progress</h3>
				<img src="" alt="Screenshot of touchpoint tracker" />
					<p class="f5">To track progress, I went through lots of methods (<em>e.g.</em>, JIRA, a faux staging environment in Abstract) but still landed on a simple text table that listed touchpoints, their owners, and documentation. We had too many non-digital touchpoints or ones that couldn&rsquo;t easily link <!-- (<em>e.g.</em>, credit card plastics, physical mail assets, email templates)  -->to existing issue tracker tools.</p>
					<p class="f5">Sometimes, a text doc just ends up being the most flexible way to PM.</p>
					<p class="f5">On the engineering side, we continued using our in-app developer menu for native mobile and leveraged <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank">Storybook</a> for web.</p>

			<h2 class="f4">Results</h2>
				<p class="f5">Easier for components to be shared across design and engineering. No longer had discrepancies in components, but even if we did, it didn&rsquo;t matter because engineers could rely on components in code to plug in instead of having to create one-off styles</p>
				<p class="f5">Design system meant consistency for customers <em>and</em> for engineers. It made it easier for engineers to build</p>
				<p class="f5">Improved communication within design team and among engineers and designers</p>

				<p class="f5">Early forays into applying design system made it clear how important a source of truth is.

				What&rsquo;s next: Swingset + in a way, making <em>managing</em> the Sketch library obsolete. Leveraged Storybook. Trivial going from wireframe to code. Engineers never need to inspect/redline again.

				Wireframe symbols to replacing with high-fidelity components (still needed for stakeholder reviews) to Swingset.
