		<h1 class="f3">The Arrow Card by LendUp</h1>
				<p class="f5">LendUp provides loans and credit cards to customers who are often denied access to credit by traditional banks. Driven by our social mission to improve people&rsquo;s financial health, we built our products with the principles of financial education, transparency, and dignity in mind.</p>
				<p class="f5">I was a Product Designer on the Arrow Card credit card from 2017&ndash;2018 and led the design of the iOS and Android mobile apps, in addition to working on web experiences and growth projects.</p>
			<h2 class="f4">Getting to know our customers</h2>
				<p class="f5">From our data, there were plenty of popular misconceptions we knew were untrue about our customers. Our customers skewed older, most were homeowners, and they often knew their finances down to the cent but didn&rsquo;t have the liquidity to help keep them permanently afloat.</p>
				<p class="f5">But&mdash;just by virtue of being employees at a Bay Area tech company&mdash;we knew we weren&rsquo;t our customers. We were always conscious of striking the right tone in our product features and copy. There was a fine line between being patronizing and being helpful.</p>
				<p class="f5">We relied on a variety of research methods to make sure we knew who our customers were and that we weren&rsquo;t designing in a silo. This included <em>ethnographic research, design sprints, usability testing, shadowing customer support calls, outbound customer feedback calls, a dedicated social impact team, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">industry</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank">reading</a></em>.</p>
<!-- 				<ul>
					<li><strong>Ethnographic research</strong> to answer <em>Who might our customers be? Who aren&rsquo;t our customers?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Feature validation</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, design sprints, to answer <em>Do customers care about any these features? Will they like the way they&rsquo;re framed?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Usability testing</strong> to answer <em>Did we satisfy the customer goals? Can people do the things we want them to be able to do?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Shadowing inbound customer support calls</strong> to answer <em>Who are our customers? How does our product succeed or fail at providing utility for them?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Post-release outbound customer calls</strong> to answer <em>Who are our customers? How do they feel about and use the product?</em></li>
					<li><strong>A dedicated social impact team</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, our financial health ombud team, who drove financial health surveys, their own ethnographic research, and provided financial health measurement indicators</li>
					<li><strong>Industry reading</strong>&mdash;Some highlights were <a href="https://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/book/" target="_blank"><em>The Financial Diaries</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em>&rsquo;s reporting on income volatility in the middle class</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">research by the CFPB</a> (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).</li>
