		<h1 class="f3">About me</h1>
			<h2 class="f5">i am cool</h2>
				<!-- <p class="f5">I was a Product Designer on the Arrow Card credit card by LendUp from 2017&ndash;2018 and led the design of the iOS and Android mobile apps from launch to over 15k users, in addition to working on web experiences and growth projects for over 115k monthly users.</p> -->
			<h2 class="f5">links + resume</h2>
<!-- 		<h2 class="f4">Getting to know our customers</h2>
			<p class="f5">There were plenty of popular misconceptions we knew were untrue about our customers when we looked at the data. Our customers skewed older, most were homeowners, and they often knew their finances down to the cent but didn&rsquo;t have the liquidity to help keep them permanently afloat.</p>
			<p class="f5">But&mdash;just by virtue of being employees at a Bay Area tech company&mdash;we knew we weren&rsquo;t our customers. We were always conscious of striking the right tone in our product features and copy. There was a fine line between being patronizing and being helpful.</p>
			<p class="f5">We used a variety of research methods to avoid designing in a silo and make sure we knew who our customers were. This included <em>ethnographic research, design sprints, usability testing, shadowing customer support calls, outbound customer feedback calls, a dedicated social impact team, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">industry</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank">reading</a></em>.</p> -->
<!-- 				<ul>
					<li><strong>Ethnographic research</strong> to answer <em>Who might our customers be? Who aren&rsquo;t our customers?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Feature validation</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, design sprints, to answer <em>Do customers care about any these features? Will they like the way they&rsquo;re framed?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Usability testing</strong> to answer <em>Did we satisfy the customer goals? Can people do the things we want them to be able to do?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Shadowing inbound customer support calls</strong> to answer <em>Who are our customers? How does our product succeed or fail at providing utility for them?</em></li>
					<li><strong>Post-release outbound customer calls</strong> to answer <em>Who are our customers? How do they feel about and use the product?</em></li>
					<li><strong>A dedicated social impact team</strong>, <em>i.e.</em>, our financial health ombud team, who drove financial health surveys, their own ethnographic research, and provided financial health measurement indicators</li>
					<li><strong>Industry reading</strong>&mdash;Some highlights were <a href="https://www.usfinancialdiaries.org/book/" target="_blank"><em>The Financial Diaries</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/my-secret-shame/476415/" target="_blank"><em>The Atlantic</em>&rsquo;s reporting on income volatility in the middle class</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-well-being/" target="_blank">research by the CFPB</a> (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).</li>

		<h1 class="f3" id="case-dashboard">Case study: Mobile app dashboard redesign</h1>

			<img src="" alt="Screenshot of finished Arrow Card mobile app" />

				<p class="f5">LendUp provides loans and credit cards to customers who are often denied access to credit by traditional banks. Driven by a social mission to improve people&rsquo;s financial health, LendUp builds products with financial education, transparency, and dignity in mind.</p>
				<!--<p class="f5">In mid-2017, I joined the Arrow Card mobile app team, and we were tasked with taking the mobile app from an MVP demo app to a fully fledged customer-facing app and LendUp&rsquo;s only native mobile product.</p> -->
				<!-- <p class="f5">The experience of the mobile app also mirrored the direction that LendUp wanted to move in as a full financial partner to our customers. Traditionally, LendUp provided loans, which are low-touch experiences (customers logged in to take out loan, then logged in just once more to pay it off), but credit cards could drive far more engagement.</p> -->
				<!-- Graph of loans vs. cards engagement, checking balances, multiple payments, checking transactions -->
				<p class="f5">I led the design of the credit card mobile app. I worked alongside a product manager, copywriter, and front-end engineer, and checked in with the design team.</p>

<!-- 			<h3 class="f5">Why the mobile app matters</h3>
				<p class="f5">At the time, the mobile app was our only in-house product customers could use to self-service their account information. Our web experience wasn&rsquo;t yet publicly available. Instead, customers who logged onto our website were sent through a third-party payment processor.</p>
				<p class="f5">Our data also showed that the mobile app:</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>drove higher daily engagement than web (a <a href="https://cfsinnovation.org/research/eight-ways-to-measure-financial-health/">measure of financial health</a> according to the CFSI)</li>
					<li>on average, monthly payments on the mobile app were 20% higher</li>
				</ul> -->

			<img src="" alt="Screenshot of Arrow Card mobile app in 2017" />
			<h2 class="f4">The problem</h2>
				<p class="f5">Our support team regularly received calls with basic questions about customers&rsquo; balance, credit, and the payment process. These calls drove about 30% of our total call volume.</p>
				<p class="f5">After digging into these calls, we knew there were improvements we could make in the usability of the app dashboard, the first screen customers landed on.</p>
			<h2 class="f4">Goals</h2>
				<p class="f5">At a high-level, our goals were to</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Decrease the number of customer calls about known issues, including the lack of clarity around available credit, credit line, and payment information. <!-- This would be <em>quantitative and measurable</em>. --></li>
					<li>Discover and address usability issues given time and resource constraints, which meant we were limited in considering a broader redesign. <!-- This would be <em>qualitative and testable</em>. --></li>
				</ul>
			<h2 class="f4">Research &amp; testing</h2>
				<p class="f5">From past research, we already knew that our customers needed to know their <strong>available credit</strong> more immediately than their current balance<!--  (which is the inverse of account dashboards aimed at consumers with prime credit) -->, and also often wanted to know their <strong>credit line</strong>. Since our customers were credit-constrained, the amount of credit they had was always top of mind.</p>
				<p class="f5">To discover any unknown issues, we ran our first usability tests on the app and also found that people</p>
				<ul class="f5">
					<li>Didn&rsquo;t want their <strong>credit score</strong> to be prominent for privacy and emotional reasons</li>
					<li>Were intrigued but weren&rsquo;t sure why we showed <strong>credit utilization</strong></li>
					<li>Couldn&rsquo;t figure out <strong>how to contact support</strong> but would instinctively scroll to find information they couldn&rsquo;t immediately find</li>
					<li>Weren&rsquo;t always sure <strong>if a payment was due</strong></li>
					<li>Often had to squint or bring their phone up close to read text in the app</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="f5">The findings confirmed much of what we knew&mdash;that our information hierarchy was unclear, that our app needed to suit audiences with different vision abilities&mdash;but also uncovered much we didn&rsquo;t know, especially around the emotional experience of checking your account information. <!-- For someone who&rsquo;s already time-, resource-, and money-constrained, there&rsquo;s much less emotional tolerance for one more frustrating experience. --></p>
			<h2 class="f4">The proposal</h2>
			<h3 class="f5">The framework for better considered hierarchy</h3>
				<p class="f5">For this project, we adopted Jason Fried&rsquo;s article <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3047-the-obvious-the-easy-and-the-possible" target="_blank">the Obvious, the Easy, and the Possible</a> (OEP) as a framework for hierarchy discussions with stakeholders. This helped direct conversations that could&rsquo;ve derailed with a comment like, &ldquo;Can you make the font bigger?&rdquo; to more productive discussions around what information to prioritize.</p>
				<p class="f5"><em>Instead of discussing isolated components, we were now discussing trade-offs</em>.</p>
				<p class="f5">From this framework and our research, I landed on a hierarchy for the mobile app dashboard.</p>

				<img src="" alt="Obvious, Easy, Possible chart for the mobile dashboard" />

			<h3 class="f5">Making it Obvious</h3>
				<h4 class="f5">Larger type, more linear information flow</h4>
					<img src="" alt="Old vs. new information flow. Animation of account carousel" />
					<p class="f5">The dashboard now prioritizes the information that customers needed most immediately: available credit, minimum payment information, and making a payment. Information that was less desired upfront was moved into a tabbed carousel.</p>
				<h4 class="f5">More discoverable contact and settings entry points</h4>
					<img src="" alt="Animation of scrolling to footer" />
					<p class="f5">Customers can get to their settings and our contact form on the dashboard instead of having to guess at whether it might be revealed by a side menu icon.</p>
				<h4 class="f5">A simplified payments card</h4>
					<img src="" alt="Moved payment information onto separate payments screen" />
					<p class="f5">We moved unnecessary payment information off the main dashboard and onto a separate payments screen to keep the payments card as obvious as possible. I worked with our copywriter to humanize the language around making payments.</p>
				<h4 class="f5">Modular card UI system</h4>
					<img src="" alt="Modular card UI system" />
					<p class="f5">This project was a testing ground for our <a href="#case-system">new card component system</a>. I developed a modular system we could use for a variety of flows and information types so we could scale our UI and front-end efficiency with new product features.</p>
				<h4 class="f5">New visual identity and style guides</h4>
					<img src="" alt="Upswing style guide snippet" />
					<p class="f5">LendUp had adopted a new visual identity, and the mobile app was the first customer servicing touchpoint designed to reflect the new brand.</p>
<!-- 			<h2 class="f4">How we got there</h2>
				<p class="f5"></p> -->
			<h2 class="f4">Releasing the new dashboard</h2>
				<p class="f5">As much upfront testing helps, releasing the new dashboard to the public meant there were still issues to be discovered. Thankfully, we had the opportunity to iterate and refine by:</p>
					<ul class="f5">
						<li>Doing a cool thing</li>
						<li>Doing another cool thing</li>
						<li>Doing something else</li>
					</ul>
			<h2 class="f4">Results</h2>
				<p class="f5">Since launch:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We&rsquo;ve cut balance and payment inquiry call volume by about 38%.</li>
						<li>We ran usability testing again, and participants found available credit, payment, and contact information faster than in previous tests.</li>
						<li>Customers have shown more focused interaction with the dashboard on the actions we want them to tap on.</li>
					</ul>

				<p class="f5">The Arrow Card app is available now on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/arrow-card/id1228440036?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lcard_app" target="_blank">Play Store</a></p>
<!-- 				<p class="f5">We&rsuo;ve also gotten great feedback from customers on the app.</p> -->
