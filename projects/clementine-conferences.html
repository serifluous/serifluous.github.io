				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>The goal of redesigning the conference call flow (the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; feature of <a href="../resume.html#resume-clementine">Clementine</a>) was to build and sustain trust with customers throughout the entire call experience.</p>

				<p>If a customer&rsquo;s tried different conference call apps, s/he&rsquo;s probably used to apps that dial a conference line using the customer&rsquo;s personal phone number. However, one of Clementine&rsquo;s value propositions is that customers receive their own business line to keep their work and personal lives separate.</p>

				<p>Prior to the redesign, Clementine&rsquo;s conference call screen looked too similar to the iOS phone UI (see below). Customers complained that they weren&rsquo;t sure if calls were being made through Clementine or through their own phone, especially if they were distracted while using the app.</p>

				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-conferences/conferences-old.png" alt="Old Clementine conference call UI" /></p>

				<p>We had two goals for the redesign to:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Create a seamless Clementine-branded conference call experience that</li>
					<li>Would be flexible when incorporating additional call features we had on the development roadmap, such as call transferring, a dial pad, and conference rescheduling.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
				<p>The landscape of enterprise communication is far-reaching. There are apps that only do text-based communication (<em>e.g.</em>, Slack, Pie), those that do text and voice (<em>e.g.</em>, Convoi), and those that do voice through another product (<em>e.g.</em>, UberConference, Hall).</p>

				<p>I looked mainly at telephony apps to get a sense how other products are handling phone calls, especially with multiple people on the line. I also took a look at more consumer-focused communication products that receive a larger scale of customers.</p>

				</ul>

				<p>General trends I found were that</p>

				<ol>
					<li>There&rsquo;s a limited number of tasks you can perform when you&rsquo;re in a call. Many apps don&rsquo;t let you return to the normal app UI.</li>
					<li>Not many apps delineated who was in the call and who wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
					<li>The ways in which you could start a conference call varied, but the majority of apps required you to start from a preexisting group, not with an ad hoc group.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Sketching</h2>
				<p>I sketched out a few ideas to get high-level feedback from the team. Questions I mulled over during sketching were:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Which call functionalities should be top-level during a call, and which can be hidden?</li>
					<li>Do customers need to be able to quickly see who&rsquo;s on a call, or is communicating through voice sufficient?</li>
					<li>How do we strike a balance between making the call experience a cohesive part of the whole product <em>and</em> making it different enough from the rest of the app so customers know for sure whenever they&rsquo;re in a call?</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Mockups</h2>

				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-conferences/conferences-sketchapp.png" alt="Screenshot of conference iterations in Sketch" /></p>

				<p>Project goals at the time prioritized branding our conference calls over other goals. It was a change our customers were clamoring for and needed to be pushed out in an immediate release.</p>

				<p>For the first round of mockups, I focused primarily on this part of the feature. I first tried using the Clementine orange to differentiate the call experience from the rest of the app. However, I quickly learned that using this color to provide contrast would be straining on the eyes and that changing color alone wouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient. The whole UI needed to adapt to the experience.</p>

				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-conferences/conferences-mockups-1.png" alt="Progress of conference UI" /></p>

				<p>The team and I settled on a conference call screen that</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Kept call controls on a bottom panel. This panel minimized as you swiped through the list of participants in the call.</li>
					<li>Organized information primarily by the <em>x</em>-axis. Information in the rest of the app is organized vertically. Using a horizontal structure allowed for more space to present vital information on the screen at once, such as participants and call controls.</li>
					<li>Still used style guidelines consistent with the rest of the app, but with a different hierarchy, especially in typography and color. Below, you can compare the UI of the main app with the conference call UI.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<p>Prototyping was a very important part of the process for this design since we wanted to put the design in the hands of users before we built out the entire conference call flow and before we shipped it live to all our customers.</p>

				<p>I built prototypes in Pixate, focusing on</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Simulating the way call controls would minimize when people scrolled through participants in a call. I wanted to find out if people would be bothered by this and would rather just see the majority of the call screen be either the list of participants or the call controls. The design had the screen split 50/50.</li>
					<li>Exploring different ways of adding more features to the call. This would be important for the next round of designs, where it would be the main focus. One of my prototypes (below) explored hiding actions behind the user avatar.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>User Testing</h2>

				<p>Since the conference call experience is such a core part of the Clementine product, it was especially important that we get feedback from our customers and new users. We sought out test subjects who worked in target industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) and might frequently make calls.</p>

				<p>During our week of testing, we learned a great deal about people&rsquo;s habits and preferences during a conference call. Chiefly, the one thing people find most important is seeing everyone currently in the call and those who have yet to join.</p>

				<p>Another key insight was that the call control panel was often confusing: people weren&rsquo;t sure how to return to the main app during a call nor how to bring back the full panel.</p>
