				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>A full-fledged desktop app was something that <a href="../resume.html#clementine-resume">Clementine</a> had been sorely lacking for a while. When the design team first started the project, the desktop app was in beta and didn&rsquo;t support much beyond the core communication features: messaging and conference calling.</p>

				<p>A desktop app was important because as a company, we wanted to support customers through their entire range of work communications. This would include features like video conferencing and screen sharing, which are less suitable for mobile.</p>

				<p>Our task was to design the entire structure of the desktop app. We thought especially about:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Sidebar and navigation organization: What information should be present in the sidebar? How do we port a conference-call focused navigation on the mobile app to desktop?</li>
					<li>How messaging and conference calling behaviors would differ between mobile and desktop</li>
					<li>How to make continuity between desktop and mobile effortless</li>
				</ul>

				<!-- <p>This case study focuses on one particular feature that I designed for our desktop app: conference calls. <a href="clementine-conferences.html">I worked on this feature for our mobile app</a>, so I knew the ins and outs of this feature and had a good grasp of how it might port to desktop.</p> -->
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Product Analysis</h2>
				<p>I looked at consumer-focused and enterprise video-conferencing apps to get a sense of how other products incorporate messaging and video calls. The vast majority keep messaging as the focus on desktop and de-emphasize conference calls.</p>

				</ul>

				<p>Looking at the organization of communication threads among the apps was also helpful. Enterprise apps generally took an &ldquo;address book&rdquo; approach, organizing message threads by type (group, individuals) and by alphabet.</p>

				<p>Most of the consumer apps took an &ldquo;activity log&rdquo; approach, listing messages by time and surfacing call history only within their respective threads. This approach seems more useful with a larger scale of contacts and frequency of messaging, where users have to rely on search or chronological context to find message threads.</p>

				<h2>Sketching</h2>
				<p>During sketching, I focused on how features on the mobile app would map to desktop and how the UI would respond to changes in the state of the app, such as when a conference call starts.</p>

				<p>For easy multi-tasking, we wanted messaging and navigation to be accessible still while a conference call was ongoing. I spent a good amount of time exploring how the screen could be segmented to allow for that.</p>

				<p>I kept the sketching process as low-level as possible since each person on the design team was working on large portions of the app simultaneously. We wanted the final design to be cohesive, so we made sure to agree on broad strokes of the design first before moving into finer details.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="section">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>UX Structure</h2>
				<p>Because desktop behaviors and conventions differ from mobile, we discussed the structure of two particular features at length: sidebar navigation and conference calls.</p>
				<p>Early on for the <strong>sidebar</strong>, we decided that taking the &ldquo;address book&rdquo; approach to listing message threads would be appropriate for our app. Since groups had their own tab in the mobile app, it made sense that they would be separate from individuals on desktop.
				<!-- We also discussed whether a &ldquo;recent calls&rdquo; tab in the sidebar would be appropriate since some people might primarily make calls through Clementine. In the end, recent calls were given their own treatment that would appear as a feed in the main center section of the app.  --> We also borrowed from Material Design and included a floating action button. This allowed people to start messages or calls from anywhere in the app, which is one of our product philosophies.</p>

				<p>Compared to mobile, the flow for <strong>conference calls</strong> on desktop was complicated by the possibility of video conferencing. To make sure I would cover all bases when designing the conference call flow, I drew up a flowchart to map out the range of possibilities:</p>
				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-desktop/desktop-flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart of desktop conference call" /></p>
				<p>This flow allows for flexibility with:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>People with limited bandwidth who only need to view one video stream at a time</li>
					<li>Switching an audio conference to a video conference</li>
					<li>Accomodating people connecting with audio-only through mobile and people connecting with video through desktop</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

		<div class="section image-background desktop-feedback">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Wireframing &amp; Feedback</h2>

				<p>We still kept designs low-fidelity when discussing with the rest of the team. Arranging the wireframes on a whiteboard made it easier to guide the whole Clementine team through the design. This allowed for a very iterative process since flows and screens throughout the app could be revised and replaced quickly.</p>

				<p>Arranging screens like this also made it obvious where interactions and UI elements in the app could be more cohesive. We found inconsistencies especially with contact/group profiles and list structures.</p>

				<p>With conference calls, it became clear that more could be done to simplify the experience. Decreasing the number of options to personalize the conference interface (<em>e.g.</em>, opening a new window for a conference, turning off others&rsquo;video streams) could help decrease the stress and distraction someone might face going into a call.</p>

				<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-desktop/desktop-mockup-2.png" alt="Screenshot of desktop mockup" /></p>
				<p>The Clementine desktop app is still a work in progress, and I&rsquo;ve started creating preliminary mockups. While we&rsquo;ve worked on much of the UX structure for the app, there&rsquo;s still more thinking to be done around actual visual hierarchy with color and typography.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ll have to revisit <a href="clementine-iconography.html">iconography</a>, too, since certain icons don&rsquo;t map especially well from mobile to desktop. With video conferencing involved, icons related to calls and conference calls start to make less sense.</p>
				<p>The desktop app design would also be a great place to look more thoughtfully at voice and tone throughout the product. The platform allows for more personality to shine through and provides more avenues for support when customers are confused or in an error state.</p>
				<p>While we&rsquo;ve done a great deal in solidifying the broad strokes of the desktop app, we still have our work cut out for us in fleshing out the finer details.</p>
