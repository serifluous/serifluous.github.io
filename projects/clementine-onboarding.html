				<h2>Goal</h2>
				<p>In redesigning the onboarding flow, my main goal was to craft the story of the <a href="../resume.html#resume-clementine">Clementine</a> experience. At the same time, onboarding should introduce new customers to four main features:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>A private Clementine number for business</li>
					<li>Effortless conference calls</li>
					<li>Secure voice and text communication</li>
					<li>Call recording and message archiving</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Our previous onboarding flow wasn&rsquo;t dynamic nor swipeable and consisted mainly of UI screenshots. Most importantly, it didn&rsquo;t tell a story.</p>

				<h2>&ldquo;Competitor&rdquo; Analysis</h2>
				<p>I pinpointed a few apps with onboarding flows that were great examples of the same high-level goals I wanted to achieve: complex interactions/ideas explained in a personable, interactive way.</p>

				<h2>Concepts &amp; Sketching</h2>
				<p>I start every project with quick sketches to get feedback without letting visuals interfere with critique. However, sketches this time were more detailed than usual since our onboarding is heavily visual. I wanted to outline illustrations/interactions early to save time during the prototyping phase.</p>

				<p>While sketching, I kept in mind that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>While Clementine is an enterprise product, it&rsquo;s still consumer-facing. The language and tone should reflect that.</li>
					<li>We have diverse customers, so each of the highlighted features needs to shine <em>and</em> fit into the product story.</li>
					<li>People go through onboarding differently. Some want to sign up right away. Others need to be wined and dined. The pacing of onboarding should be flexible.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Mockups</h2>
				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-onboarding/onboarding-sketchapp-1.png" alt="Sketch screenshot of signup screen" /></p>
				<p class="caption" style="text-align:center;margin-top:-10px">Landing screen mockups</p>

				<p>Storyboarding in Sketch quickly made it clear that:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>My idea to convey how Clementine separates your work and personal life was too subtle. The illustrations for work life and home life didn&rsquo;t provide enough contrast to emphasize this feature effectively.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-onboarding/onboarding-sketchapp-2.png" alt="Sketch screenshot of work and personal life onboarding" /></p>

				<ul>
					<li>My idea to feature secure messaging, however, was too over-the-top. The animations and illustrations I had planned would either obscure text or too strictly control pacing for users through the onboarding flow.
				</ul>

				<p class="pimage"><img src="clementine-onboarding/onboarding-sketchapp-3.png" alt="Sketch screenshot of secure messaging onboarding" /></p>

				<p>The ultimate story I settled on started from a high-level use case (customers who needed to separate their work and personal communications) that pinpointed more specific features as customers swiped through the onboarding screens. Each screen introduces a single Clementine feature and uses bold but restrained animations to keep the customer&rsquo;s attention focused on a single point on the screen, rather than struggling to keep up.</p>

				<h2>Prototyping</h2>
				<p>After tweaking my designs, I hopped into Framer (for the first time ever to seriously work on a project). The design team at Clementine traditionally uses Pixate and Flinto for interaction prototyping, but I felt the animations for onboarding were complex enough to warrant finally getting my hands dirty with Framer.</p>

				<h2>Next Steps &amp; Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>Clementine&rsquo;s onboarding is still in the building stage. We haven&rsquo;t had the time to put it into the hands of actual new users, but here are some lessons from the early stages:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Fail early and fast. Constant feedback during the early stages is crucial. I could&rsquo;ve saved even more time with illustration by pulling people in to get more feedback than I was already doing.</li>
					<li>I was able to really improve my interaction design and storytelling skills during this project. The more complex the story, the more important it is to keep it simple and friendly.</li>
					<li>Framer still needs work when it comes to timing animations. Relying on event listeners got increasingly messy with the number of moving parts. I still had to rely on Pixate for some parts of prototyping. I might try my hand with Form next.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In improving our onboarding, there&rsquo;s still more thinking to be done around nudging customers to pay subscription fees for the service. This payment prompt currently appears after signup, but a more seamless flow between new user onboarding and payment is important for conversion.</p>
